<h3>MongoDB and Mongoose üìÉü¶¶</h3>

</div>

## What is this

This repo contains the project created for FreeCodeCamp's [MongoDB and Mongoose](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#mongodb-and-mongoose), part of the Back-End Development track.

## Inspiration

Wanted to finish the Back-End Development curriculum.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `node`

## Getting fcc-boilerplate-mongo

To install fcc-boilerplate-mongo, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/fcc-boilerplate-mongo
cd fcc-boilerplate-mongo
```

## Using fcc-boilerplate-mongo

This repo was created to help new developers get started with MongoDB, Mongoose and learn basics of NoSQL, and to help people who are trying to complete FCC's Back-End Development certification.

Go through the commit history of this repo to understand the solutions to different exercises.

To run the app locally: `npm start`

## How it was built

fcc-boilerplate-mongo was built using [boilerplate-mongo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mongomongoose/) as a starting point.

## Challenges faced

- Not a challenge but a learning experience, in order to make tests that depend on the environment variables, we have to update the .env file on Glitch as well.

## What I learned

- Got to learn how to use the MongoDB Atlas.
- Played around with mongosh.
- Learned how to use Mongoose, and explored its features.
- Used MongoDB as an ORM.

Hit the ‚≠ê button if you found this useful.
